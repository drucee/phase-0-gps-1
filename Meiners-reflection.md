## What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was still a shakey with my confidence keeping my branches organized and feeling like the changes I was making, adding, and commiting were going to make it all the way through to the remote master.

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
We clarified differences between git and GitHub, learned "pull" effectively does what "fetch" and "merge" do together and most importantly gained experience working as a pair navigating and driving.

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
We asked about branches and GitHub permissions and clarifying work flow order. Also help with markdown syntax and pull requests.

## What still confuses you about git?
Still working on visualizing and organizing my branches but it's getting better.

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
This was a positive experience, I enjoyed working with partners and look forward to more.
