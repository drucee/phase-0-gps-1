What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was having difficulty with keeping branches organized and remembering the order of the git pull request workflow.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
We clarified the differences between git and GitHub, and we learned that the pull command was equivalent to fetch and merge. We also had our first experience with pair-programming.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked the guide to clarify the workflow order. I also needed some help with markdown syntax and with doing a pull request on someone else's code.
What still confuses you about git?
I am still shaky on the workflow order for a pull request, but I figure that will come with experience.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I found the experience helpful because we were able to help each other out, and the guide was also helpful in keeping things moving and getting us unstuck.
